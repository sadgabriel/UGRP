Parameter: enemy_count

Description:
    The enemy_count parameter specifies the total number of enemies (E) to be placed within the dungeon. Enemies are scattered throughout the dungeon and can be placed in various rooms or corridors. The exact positioning of enemies is determined during map generation, but the total count will always match the value of enemy_count.

Range:
    The value of map_size can range from 10 to 26.

Constraints:
    The map must contain exactly enemy_count enemies.
    Enemies can be placed in rooms but should not be placed outside the dungeon boundaries.
