Parameter: map_size

Description:
    The map_size parameter defines both the width and height of the entire dungeon. The dungeon is composed of rooms, and its overall width and height must be exactly equal to the map_size. In other words, the dungeon’s horizontal and vertical dimensions are fixed to the map_size.

Range:
    The value of map_size can range from 17 to 27.

Constraints:
    The dungeon’s width (distance from the leftmost to the rightmost point) and height (distance from the topmost to the bottommost point) must both be exactly equal to the map_size.
    While the layout and shape of the dungeon are flexible, its overall size must always be exactly map_size x map_size. All rooms and corridors must fit precisely within this fixed size.
    For example, if map_size is 20, the dungeon's width and height must each be exactly 20, and the dungeon cannot be either larger or smaller than this.
